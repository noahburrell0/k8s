# Hello Akuity ðŸ‘‹

## What is this repository?

This repository is where I keep the configurations for my personal homelab. I've added in a guestbook application and Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana for this technical challenge.

## Grafana

I've made Grafana externally accessible for this technical challenge, you can view it here: https://grafana.akuity.burrell.tech/

The Argo CD dashboard can be directly accessed at this URL: https://grafana.akuity.burrell.tech/d/LCAgc9rWz/argocd?orgId=1

**Username:** `admin`

**Password:** `prom-operator`

## Guestbook

I've also deployed a guestbook application, it is externally accessible here: https://guestbook.akuity.burrell.tech/

## Where is everything?

### Application and project definitions

You can find the application and project definitions for Argo CD in [argocd](argocd), the guestbook and prometheus applications are located in [argocd/applications/akuity](argocd/applications/akuity).

The app-of-apps is here: [argocd/app-of-apps.yaml](argocd/app-of-apps.yaml)

### Configurations

All manifests, Helm values, etc., are located in [configs](configs). You can check the [configs/akuity](configs/akuity) directory for the guestbook and Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana configurations.

## Self-Managing Argo CD

Part of the requirements outlined "a self-managed Argo CD" instance. I wasn't sure if this meant self-hosted (ie. not using the Akuity or Codefresh type of hosted offerings), or if it meant that Argo CD should be self-managing.

Regardless, I already have a self-managing Argo CD instance. Any changes I make to Argo CD's configurations will automatically be applied by Argo CD once committed without the need to manually issue a `kubectl` command.

The application definition is here: [argocd/applications/setup/argocd.yaml](argocd/applications/setup/argocd.yaml)

And Argo CD's configurations are here: [configs/setup/argocd](configs/setup/argocd)


## Alerting

### Prometheus/Alertmanager/Grafana

The monitoring stack is installed using the prometheus-community `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart. The values I used are here [configs/akuity/prometheus/values.yaml](configs/akuity/prometheus/values.yaml).

In addition to the values file, the additional configurations I used to enable email alerting and the Argo CD Grafana dashboard are available here [configs/akuity/prometheus/configs](configs/akuity/prometheus/configs)

### Argo CD notifications

Alerts are fired by Argo CD notifications to Alertmanager. The configurations for Argo CD notifications can be found at [configs/setup/argocd/overlay/argocd-install.yaml#L70](configs/setup/argocd/overlay/argocd-install.yaml#L70)

The alerts that can be triggered are based on the following application conditions:
- On deployment (application is synced and healthy)
- On degraded
- On sync failure
- On sync status unknown
- On sync status outofsync

In addition to the alerts fired by Argo CD, the standard set of rules/alerts Prometheus ships with are also enabled. I have not configured any additional Prometheus rules to cover Argo CD specifically.

### Alert delivery

All alerts that go though Alertmanager are configured to be delivered by email (to noah+alerting@burrell.tech) though my [SMTP relay](configs/internal/smtp).







<!-- # Self-Managing Kubernetes Homelab w/ ArgoCD

This repository serves as the immutable source of configurations for my personal homelab and is deployed using ArgoCD. The configurations contained in the repository self-manage ArgoCD as well as the applications. With various operators like external-dns, cert-manager, and metallb, this homelab pretty much manages itself. Once set up, there is zero intervention required to keep things running.

Applications are divided into ArgoCD projects by their respective types.

- `setup` - Required base components used to operate the cluster and deployments.
  - ArgoCD Application Definitions: `argocd/applications/setup`
  - Configurations: `configs/setup/`
- `external` - Externally facing applications.
  - ArgoCD Application Definitions: `argocd/applications/external`
  - Configurations: `configs/external/`
- `internal` - Internal-only applications.
  - ArgoCD Application Definitions: `argocd/applications/internal`
  - Configurations: `configs/internal/`

## Bootstrapping

ArgoCD needs to be manually bootstrapped before it can self-manage. The only pre-requisite is a Kubernetes cluster with a CNI installed. All other required components will be install after bootstrapping.

```
kubectl apply -k configs/setup/argocd/
kubectl apply -f argocd/app-of-apps.yaml -n argocd
```

The above commands will deploy ArgoCD and the `app-of-apps` application which will be used to discover and deploy all other applications out of this repository. From this point forward, ArgoCD will also self-manage. Any updates to `configs/setup/argocd/` will be automatically discovered and applied.

## Secrets

All secrets are encrypted and stored in this repository using [sealed-secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) by Bitnami. Only I hold the decryption keys for the secrets in this repository. If you are using this repository as the basis for you own homelab or Kubernetes cluster, be aware that none of the sealed secrets here will unseal for you. You will need seal your own secrets and replace mine. As a result, if you try to deploy the applications contained in this repository using my configurations, the application will most likely be broken.
