Failed to sync prometheus CRD:
    CustomResourceDefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com" is invalid: metadata.annotations: Too long: must have at most 262144 bytes
    Problem caused by `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation. Fix is to set the Application sync option "ServerSideApply=true"
